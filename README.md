# BuildAWebsite-Thanush

This project is a static website made for a course assignment. It is a fan website for FC Barcelona, a football (soccer) club. The website is organized into multiple HTML pages and uses images and CSS for styling.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main website files:
  - `home.html`, `one.html`, `two.html`, `three.html`: The main HTML pages of the website.
  - `404.html`: Custom error page for non-existent routes.
  - `webstyle.css`: The main stylesheet for the website.
- **assets/**: Contains images used throughout the website (players, stadiums, trophies, etc.).

## How to Use

1. Open any of the HTML files in the `src/` directory in your web browser to view the website. 
   Recommendeded to open the home.html file as that is the homepage.
2. Ensure the `assets/` folder is in the same directory as `src/` so that images load correctly.
